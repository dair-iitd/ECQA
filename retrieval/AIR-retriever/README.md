# AIR-retriever
AIR retriever for Multi-Hop QA - ACL 2020 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01218)

## Running Experiments:

1] Please download the MultiRC dataset from https://github.com/CogComp/multirc
The train and dev sets are available in the above link.

2] Running "python3 AIR_evidence_retrieval_scores.py" shows the justification selection performance of AIR. Please change the directory of GLoVe embeddings (line 16 of the file) as per your GLoVe files. 

3] Running "python3 main_MultiRC_passages_from_topN_Iterative_alignments_PARALLEL_evidences.py" generates the train and dev files for the QA tasks with various parallel evidences. We had followed the binary classification approach for every candidate answer in the QA task (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01218), hence the files are in MRPC format which makes it easier to train any transformer based approach (RoBERTa, XLnet or BERT) from the huggingface library.
